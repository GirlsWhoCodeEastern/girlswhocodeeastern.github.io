<br>Promise Yourself</br>
<br>To be so strong that nothing<br>can disturb your peace of mind.<br>To talk health, happiness, and prosperity<br>to every person you meet.</br>
<br>To make all your friends feel<br>that there is something in them<br>To look at the sunny side of everything<br>and make your optimism come true.
<br>To live in faith that the whole world is on your side
<br>so long as you are true to the best that is in you.”</br>
